# [Classpert's Building a Programming Language](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/building-a-programming-language/cohort)

Selene is a general purpose language built on top of Lua and Lpeg. This language is designed to be a tool for students to learn the basics of implementing, building, compiling and interpreting languages.

## Structure

For this course, Roberto continuously updates the file interpreter.lua. To help the students understand the progress of the course, each end-of-lesson version of the file will be located in a folder called "lesson-NUMBER". The NUMBER in the folder name represents the number of the lesson, with a total of 8 lessons in the course. This way, students can easily compare their work with Roberto's or refer back to previous versions of the file for any reason. 

`lesson-0` folder is a clean slate.
